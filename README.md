# Xamarin.Forms.GridView
A working! GridView for xamarin forms 

Supports UWP (ItemsPanelTemplate set to ItemsWrapGrid), Android (Recycler)  and IOS (UICollectionView)

90% of android and ios renderer code came from https://github.com/twintechs/TwinTechsFormsLib. However this solution was not working for me and so I ended up making several changes. There were also some features removed that I didn't need and/or was causing undesired behaviour.

Note that grouping is not currently working on ios.
